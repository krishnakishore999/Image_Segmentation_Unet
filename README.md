# Image_Segmentation_Unet

* Built my own U-Net
* Implemented semantic image segmentation on the CARLA self-driving car dataset
* Applied sparse categorical crossentropy for pixelwise prediction


* Flowchart : loading Packages --> Loading Data --> Split Data to masked and unmasked images --> Preprocessing Data --> U-Net Upsampling Block -->U-Net Downsampling Block --> Building Model --> Training Model -->Conclusion



#Refernences :
* U - Net papers
* building this project is a part of Coursera's deep learning specialization , hence implemented ideas from it .
(Couldn't upload the data files as they were too large)
